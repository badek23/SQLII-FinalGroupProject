# SQL II Final Group Project

### About this project
I completed this project in December 2023 in collaboration with 5 other students as our final project for our Master's-level SQL II class.
The project was given as follows:
1. Create an Entity Relation Diagram (ERD) for your data model.
2. Create DDL and DML statements for each table.
3. Use SQL to answer the 4 given questions plus make up a 5th business question and utilize SQL to answer it. See SQL Project Description for a deep-dive explanation of the project.

### Technologies 
This project is scripted in SQL utilizing MySQL Workbench.

### Challenges
I have a substantial amount of professional experience scripting in SQL. However, I had never created a data model from scratch before. It was a fantastic learning opportunity to better understand in both a theoretical and hands-on fashion so many of the topics and rules that I had learned on-the-job.
